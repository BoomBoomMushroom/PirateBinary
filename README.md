# Pirate Binary (ARrRrrrr ARRrRrrR ARRRrrRr ARRrrrrR ARRRrRrr ARRrrRrR ARrrrrr ARrrrrRr ARRrRrrR ARRrRRRr ARRrrrrR ARRRrrRr ARRRRrrR)

This is a fun little website I put together to convert text into their binary representation, but with a pirate spin on it!

Each Arrrrrrrr is a character. Lets break it down

A   - The first character, it's just here to look cool
r/R - The next/last 8 characters, if it is lowercase thats a 0, if it is upper case then its a 1

Now you can decode any pirate speak! (Or use the website)
